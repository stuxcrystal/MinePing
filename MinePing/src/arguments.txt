Preinstalled Resolvers:
=======================
A resolver is a piece of code that provides the ipranges to the software.
There are some preinstalled resolvers in the software.

Default
-------
  The "default" resolver adds a parameter "--range" that can be specified
  multiple times. Each parameter registers a range in a special format
  that allows to specify all ranges.
  --range=<Range>        A single range.

Subnet
------
  The "subnet" resolver adds a parameter "--range" that can be specified
  multiple times. Each parameter registers a range in the CIDR-Format.
  --range=<Range>        A single range.

Subnet-File
-----------
  The "subnet:file" resovler allows to specify a file with several subnets.
  Each subnet is separated by a file.
  --range-file=<File>    The file containing the subnets in CIDR-Notation.


Preinstalled Pingers:
=====================
A pinger is an extension to MinePing that performs the retrival of data of
a server of the range.

Because this can be used in multiple ways, no pinger is defined by this
software.

Preinstalled Writers:
=====================
A writer formats the result of a pinger. For example a file could be written
as a XML-File as well as a CSV-File and a writer can handle some of these
Formats.

CSV
---
  This writer stores the values into a csv-file.
  --separator=<Separator>         The separator char.
  --no-header                     Don't print a header.

Preinstalled Strategies:
========================
A strategy handles the way how the software is executing its pings.

static
------
  This strategy creates a fixed amount of threads that are executing a ping.
  --threads=<Threads>             The amount of threads to be created.

pool
----
  This strategy uses a thread pool.

  --max-threads=<Threads>         Maximal amount of threads                *1
  --max-requests=<Requests>       Maximal amount of requests stored in queue.

  *1 If the amount of threads is zero, the maximal count of threads is
     unlimited.
